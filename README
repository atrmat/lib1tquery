This is awaiting some prettier packaging, including documentation
(which will be done after my thesis).

Before this is done, looking at the repository svk/svk-ngram-tools
may be helpful for anyone who needs to understand how the library
is used. This repository contains lib1tquery as well as additional
code for my thesis. (The "lib1tquery" repository will be updated
in the future.)

Specific questions can be directed to the author at steinarvk@gmail.com .
